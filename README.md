You will ask the user for the name of an event, the month it is happening, along with the day and year it is happening. If the user incorrectly enters one of those values, a default value is set instead. The user can do this for as many events as they have.
After the user has entered all of the events, the whole list of events (along with their date) should be output to the user.
